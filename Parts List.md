The guages are made to be as simple as possible to make but allow enough flexibilty to allow them to be used to display a wide range of data types.

The main parts are:

1) Node MCU Arduino Board - we have been using the [MakerHawk boards](https://www.amazon.co.uk/MakerHawk-Internet-Development-Wireless-Micropython/dp/B07M8Q38LK/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=nodemcu&qid=1634650644&sr=8-4_)
However, any Arudino compatiable board will suffice, the ease of using the above boards is the code will work without and changes to the pins.

2) SG90 Servo - any SG90 style servo will work, we would however recommend the MG90S Micro Servo as it provides a smoother travel to the gauage pointer.

3) Lights - [https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/white-led-backlight-module?variant=36999548170](Pimorini White LED Backlight Module â€“ 38.7mm x 11.9mm) x 2, although any low power led will also suffice

4) PLA for 3D Printing - Any PLA for the main parts, the dials graphics are printed on paper and laid flat on a disc (see 3D Printer Files) printed in transparent PLA.
This can be left out but it allow the dial to lay flat and provides a nice diffused light. eSun Transparent PLA works well.
